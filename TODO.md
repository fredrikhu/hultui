# HultUI — Implementation TODO

## Just Completed
- **IME composition** — `SDL_EVENT_TEXT_EDITING` plumbed through `EventTranslator → TextEditingEvent`. `TextInputElement` and `TextAreaElement` render the preedit inline at the caret with a thin underline across the whole preedit and a thick underline on the active IME segment. `SDL_SetTextInputArea` is called each frame on the focused input so OS candidate windows snap to the caret; `SDL_ClearComposition` fires on blur. Custom candidate-list rendering is deliberately skipped — the OS-native window is used instead. New `ITextInputHost` abstraction in `HultUI.Core.Platform`; `SDL3TextInputHost` is the implementation. 9 unit tests covering the state machine.

## Up Next (in order)

## Deferred
- Platform accessibility bridges (AT-SPI2, UIAutomation, NSAccessibility)
